            I feel that during this project I struggled with using the flexbox from bootstrap. When making my columns and rows. When trying to create the borders I tried using "border-right border-dark"
            as how the doc sheet from bootstrap states and I was not able to get the formating correct. I ended up having to create a inline CSS style to get the correct effect that I was wanting
            Another problem that I ran into and that I still could not get to be how I wanted it was my homepage. I tried to make the homepage take up the entire screen by using various methods such 
            as h-100 to make the height of the container fill the screen. I still have not found a proper solution to correct this. I figured I might be able to create an inline css style to correct this
            but I ran out of time for the project and did not get around to changing that. Overall I really enjoyed working with html,css and the various frameworks and would like to learn more on my own time.
